## What are we doing?

### The project

This project is one of the nine research grantees that are part of the inaugural cohort of [Global South AI4COVID Program][link_Global_South_AI4COVID], which is funded by [Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC)][link_IDRC] and the [Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)][link_SIDA], with support from [Pulse Lab Jakarta][link_PulseLabJakarta] of the United Nations Global Pulse network.
The project seeks to lay the foundations for the incorporation of frontier technologies and techniques such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS) in order to detect potential epidemic outbreaks early and favor preventive public health decision-making, based on evidence and with gender perspective, both at the national, sub-national and local levels. We start from the diagnosis that for this purpose it is mandatory to have quality digital data and generate the conditions for progressively the whole jurisdictions and provinces to implement an Electronic Health Record (EHR), in which the "primary data" resulting from the health service provided to users, which is essential to move towards a more effective and efficient public health system.

### Activities

To this end, the project is divided into four groups of activities:
* The first includes activities related to the development of AIyDS solutions for the early detection of potentially epidemic diseases on clinical databases from EHR already implemented in public health service providers; The mitigation of gender biases will be specially addressed through the development of models that contemplate fairness strategies in AI. What other data sources can be safely and effectively integrated to improve the performance of predictive tools based on AIyDS will be analyzed.
* The second group is related to the expansion of functionalities, through a multidisciplinary investigation, of the EHR of the Ministry of Health of the Nation (SNOMED-CT standard, currently developed at the minimum viable product level and not yet implemented in any health establishment) . This group of activities includes the integration of AIyCD solutions with substantial improvements in the gender perspective.
* The activities of the third group are aimed at the pilot implementation of the expanded EHR in health centers of the first level of care and hospital guards in health areas with vulnerable neighborhoods, taking into account the socioeconomic conditions that may affect the early detection of outbreaks epidemic. The implementation includes the training of health personnel and the sensitization of users to favor the success of the strategy. 
* Finally, the last group includes activities present throughout the entire project, which include tasks of planning, monitoring, evaluation, dissemination and documentation of the experience (among them, the construction of a scalability strategy).


## Who are we?

This project is a consortium of four institutions: [Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios en Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (CIECTI)][link_CIECTI] (the leader), [Ministerio de Salud de la Nación][link_Ministerio_Salud] and [Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de la Nación][link_MinCyT].

The multidisciplinary nature of the project requires the contributions of talented professionals from the most diverse areas. We are a big team that continues growing!
